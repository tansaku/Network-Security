Feature: Map Network
  As an IT administrator
  So I can see the layout of the companies network
  I want to map out the local area network

Scenario: Mapping Network
  When I go to the home page
  And I click on "map network"
  Then I should see All Ip addresses and associated ip addresses AND MAC_ADDRESSES on the LAN
  ALONG WITH All open ports and visible network vulnerabilities
  in a graphical way
