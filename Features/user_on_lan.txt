Feature: Map out users on Network
  As an IT administrator
  So I can who is on the network
  View the people currently using the network (Wireless and wired)

Scenario: Seeing non compliant users
  When I go to the home page
  And I click on "See users"
  Then I should see All Ip addresses AND MAC ADDRESSES using the network
  Then it should run them through a list of verified users
  Since MAC ADDRESSES never change, the program runs mac addresses on a verified MAC ADDRESS list
  Then correlates them to there last IP Address, assuming company uses DHCP or Vlan, ip address matchup
  is not a priority. if MAC Address doesn't have a match on verified list, raises a red flag on program
  If ip address doesnt correlate to verified list, it raises a yellow flag
