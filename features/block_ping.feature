Feature: Block Pings
  As an IT administrator
  Block pings

# COMMENTED AS NOT IN CUCUMBER FORMAT
#Scenario: DDoS Attack on Network
#  A hacker can find a network by sending a ping
#  To avoid this, program should be able to detect hostile pings and block them
#  Normally you solve this by configuring router and firewall so it wont respond to network pings
#  When admin wants to turn on firewall, he clicks "Turn On Firewall" to turn on Firewall
#  Which is programed to not let in anything using ports outside of verified ports
